A set of functions that I found handy during the development of the [repliCATS pipeline](https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/) that ive ported into this package. The goal of **ContainR** is to enable easier container development for computational reproducibility. The package ports the [rocker-versioned](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) stacks and basic [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/reference/) commands to R. 

It is currently a work in progress and welcome any issues and comments. 

[Read more about the Rocker Project](https://rocker-project.org/)

## Overview

At its core a user can run the `docker_run()` function which will launch the `rocker/rstudio:latest` stack into a Docker container, port **local config** and **environment** settings into the container and activate the Rstudio project in a virtual session. Wrappers for the basic Docker commands allow for ease of starting and stopping the container. 

Included images of the [rocker-versioned](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) stacks can be found by exploring the `data_rocker_table` inside the package or visiting their [repository](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) to learn more. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ContainR)

data_rocker_table
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ContainR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychtek/ContainR")
```

### Docker Check 
Check if Docker is installed on the system or visit install instructions for [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/):

```r
docker_check()
```

### ContainR Addin

ContainR installs two basic functions into the `Addins` menu, `Run Project in Rocker(Rstudio)` and `Stop rocker` which will launch the `rocker/rsudio:latest` container and copy your config settings and active rstudio project. This doesnt install any packages however, is isolated from your local R library. Its a quick way to explore a Rocker stack and build a container based around your workflow. 

## Workflow 

- Install **ContainR** package `devtools::install_github("psychtek/ContainR")`.
- Open your current working Rstudio project. 
- Explore which base [Rocker image](https://rocker-project.org/) to use `ContainR::data_rocker_table`.
- Create a Dockerfile `docker_file()`.
- Build a container `docker_build()`.
- Run the new Docker file (Launches browser) `docker_run()`.

## Usage

### Create a Dockerfile 

The benefit of this package is to allow a researcher ease of developing a container without deep dive learning about Docker commands. The `docker_file()` function is an attempt to make it easier to create a `Dockerfile` by allowing the user to: 

1) choose the Rocker base image; 

2) choose to install either your local `loaded`, `installed` or `none` packages;

3) choose which version (tag);

4) choose to included python (pandas and numpy). 

```r
docker_file(dockerfile = "inst/dockerfiles/Dockerfile",
                        which_pkgs = c("loaded", "installed", "none"),
                        name = c("rstudio", "tidyerse", "verse", "geospatial", "binder"),
                        tag = NULL,
                        include_python = FALSE)

```

The install scripts also skip any packages already installed on the base Rocker image. 

### Build a Docker Container 

The `docker_build()` function will then read the newly created `Dockerfile` and build the image based on the previous user requirements. This is saved to the local
Docker registery and images can be view with the `docker_images()` function. 

```r
docker_build(dockerfile =  "inst/dockerfiles/Dockerfile", name = "psychtek/imagename")
```

### Launch a Container

Finally,`docker_run()` is can then be used (with the user supplied Docker image) to launch a Rstudio container in the browser, activating the current working project. Packages provided in the `which_pkgs = c("loaded", "installed", "none")` argument preference should be available. Your custom theme and layout should also be ready and a clone of the working Rstudio project should be available. 

```r
rocker_run(image = "psychtek/imagename", tag = "latest")

```
 
## Benefits and Uses

When a container is launched **none of your local Rstudio settings are preserved** in the built image. Only the R packages and Rocker stack that were chosen during the *build* are preserved. This allows the user the choice to explore a Rocker image or build into the image R packages used with the current active Rstudio project. **Future plans is to allow the user to copy the working directory into the container image**. Separating this allows for the separation of environment and package development choices. 

The Docker image can also be pushed to [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) and shared with others for collaboration on a project so that the team is using the same environment for development. 

Ease of exploring a package within Rstudio using ephemeral or persistent containers.

There are similar packages available such as [dockr](https://github.com/smaakage85/dockr) or [devindocker](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/devindocker) which provide various levels of functionality. We also recommend checking these out to see if these address your requirements.
