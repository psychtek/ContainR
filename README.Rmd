A set of functions that I found handy during the development of the [repliCATS pipeline](https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/) that I've ported into this package. 

## Overview

The key problems to irreproducibility of data in research is missing *documentation*, *version control* and *containerization*. `ContainR` seeks to address the container issue by making it easier to create the environment for a R project in a docker image without the need for in depth understanding of docker. The final product is a docker recipe and image with documented metadata for computational reproducibility.  

The package ports the [rocker-versioned](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) Rstudio stacks and basic [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/reference/) commands to R. Based on whatever Rstudio project is currently active, it allows the user to create a Dockerfile with choices to include attached CRAN packages (including Github packages), include Python, Julia, jupyter, Pandoc etc. and launch the Rstudio container in a browser. 

Once the image has baked any additional packages into the base Rocker stack, the dockerfile can be saved for distribution and the image pushed to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/). When a **ContainR session** is launched, your local config settings can also *cloned* into the session for previewing before hard coding the package directory into the docker image.

It is currently a work in progress and welcome any [issues and comments](https://github.com/psychtek/ContainR/issues).

### System Requirements

[Docker](https://docker-docs.netlify.app/install/) is required for the use of this package with support only tested for `R (>= 4.0.0)` base images. 

### Installation

You can install the development version of `ContainR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/psychtek/ContainR) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychtek/ContainR")
```

#### Docker Check 

Check if Docker is installed on the system or visit install instructions for [OSX](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/):

```r
docker_check()
```


### Rocker-Versioned Images

Supported [rocker-versioned](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) stacks can be found by exploring the `data_rocker_table` inside the package or visiting their [repository](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2) to learn more. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(containr)

data_rocker_table |> dplyr::select(-base_image)
```

## Workflow Basics

- Open your current working Rstudio project. 
- Explore which base [Rocker image](https://rocker-project.org/) to use `containr::data_rocker_table`.
- **Create** a Dockerfile `containr$new()`.
- **Build** a container `build_image(TRUE)`.
- **Run** the container (Launches browser) `start()`.
- **Stop** the container `stop()`

#### Create a Dockerfile 

For example, to create a Dockerfile based on the latest Rocker Rstudio and install packages that are loaded into the local session, add python support and install the active project from `CMD CHECK` archive: 

```r
containr <- containr$new(image = "rstudio", name = "project_name", 
packages = "loaded", copy = TRUE, include_python = TRUE)
```

The return process from this function results in the creation of a `docker/Dockerfile` with additional scripts in the `docker/scripts/` directory. If any packages require install from Github, the function take note of these and attempt to add them to the install file as well. Any packages already installed on the base Rocker image will be skipped.

#### View Preferences 

At any point you can check and change what was initialized. This will clear the `docker` folder and re-write the folder and scripts according to your preferences. Calling the `print()` will give you sanity checks for your preferences and the **Status** will update automatically. 

<img src="inst/figures/print_settings_command.png" align="centre"/>

The `proc()` will display the running container which at this point, we have nothing built or running: 

<img src="inst/figures/check_process.png" align="centre"/>

#### Build a ContainR

Setting the `build_image(TRUE)` flag will then read the newly created `Dockerfile` and build the image based on the previous user requirements. This is saved to the local Docker register and images can be view with the `docker_images()` function.

> Note that this can take some time depending on your install preferences. 

#### Start
When this finished building the image is now ready to be started. The `start()` fun will launch the container in a background process but if we run the `proc()` then we can see that it is up and running. 

<img src="inst/figures/process_active.png" align="centre"/>

You can run the `docker_images()` to view the Docker register of built images. 

<img src="inst/figures/docker_images.png" align="centre"/>

#### Launch 

Running `launch()` will open a the session in a new browser window. 

#### Stop

Running `stop()` will stop the container session completely leaving the image built intact. 

## Docker Wrapper & Other Info

A basic docker wrapper is also included that will build functionality as development continues. Like the `containr` object, this is also a [R6](https://github.com/r-lib/R6) class object. Currently included are three functions: 

- `docker_images()`: returns a tibble of built images. Equivalent terminal command is `docker image ls` but it was difficult to work with the terminal output so this now makes things easier to work within R environment. 

- `docker_containers()`: Returns a tibble of active containers. Equivalent terminal command is `docker container ls`. 

- `docker_search("rstudio")`: Returns a tibble of search results. 

To run a docker command you can do it direct:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
containr::docker$new(process = "docker",
    commands = "image",
    options = "ls")$show_output()
```

or with the included functions: 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
containr::docker_images()
```

Search dockerhub for images: 


```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
containr::docker_search("rocker")
```


> Note that tibble output has only been included for the `image`, `container` and `search` commands for now. This will be expanded over the course of development and value any comments or feedback.
