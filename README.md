# ContainR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ContainR is to enable easier container development for
computational reproducibility.

There are similar packages available such as
[dockr](https://github.com/smaakage85/dockr) or
[devindocker](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/devindocker) which provide
various levels of functionality. We also recommend checking these out to
see if these suit your requirements.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ContainR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("psychtek/ContainR")
```
